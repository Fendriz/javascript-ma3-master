1. In your own words, describe what JavaScript Code Style is.

	Javascript code style is a way to write code that makes it fit into the javascript ecosystem. Makes it easier for other people to read your code.  standards:
		2 spaces for indentation

	A good practice is to check your code against a Linter like JSLint or JSHint....
